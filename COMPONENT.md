## To use as a component
```shell
npm i vigour-thing --save
```

```javascript
exports.thing = {
  type: 'thing'
}
```

## To run in isolation
To be able to run, you need `vpack` runner and `vigour-element` for browser rendering.
```shell
npm i vpack -g && npm i
```

And then to run using `vpack`, use:
```shell
npm run dev
```
